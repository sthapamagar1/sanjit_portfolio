## Overview
This project focuses on automating web scraping to extract event data from dynamic web pages. Using Selenium and BeautifulSoup, the scraper efficiently gathers, processes, and exports structured data for further analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementation.
- **Selenium**: Automates browser interactions to extract dynamically loaded content.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Parses and processes HTML data efficiently.
- **Pandas**: Cleans, structures, and formats the extracted data.
- **CSV Export**: Stores processed data for analysis and insights.

## Features
- **Automated Data Extraction**: Handles dynamic content loading via Selenium.
- **Data Processing & Validation**: Uses Pandas to structure and clean the extracted data.
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust exception handling for reliability.
- **CSV Export**: Outputs structured data for further analysis and visualization.
